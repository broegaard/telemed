/**
 * Game Lobby project - a simplified system for pairing a number of
 * players waiting to join distributed games; the main focus is
 * the learning goal of showing how objects can be created on
 * a server in a client-server architecture, and made available for
 * remote communication in clients, using the Broker pattern.
 *
 * <p>
 *   The current architecture is suitable but the implemented
 *   behavior have a number of limitations, aimed at reducing
 *   code complexity. Specifically, A) only two player games are
 *   supported: the first player creates the game, and the second
 *   player joins it; B) the resulting 'game' has no behavior at
 *   all, except allowing players to view the names of the two players;
 *   C) error handling is over-simplified, for instance there is
 *   no check that a third player joins a game.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The interaction is described in 'Flexible, Reliable, Distributed
 *   Software', published on leanpub.com.
