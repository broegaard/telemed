/**
 * Facade for the XDS (Cross-Enterprise Document Storage) system. This is a
 * database system that stores XML documents representing the tele observations
 * for patients. XDS operates with two databases: the registry in which meta
 * data is stored for all documents in a set of repositories; and the repository
 * (-ies) that stores the actual documents.
 * <p>
 * This architecture allows scaling, as a single registry can index a vast
 * number of individual repositories that may be distributed geographically,
 * e.g. a single registry can all find health information for a given patient
 * even though the individual repositories with the data are located in
 * different hospitals.
 * <p>
 * The present interface is of course a very scaled down variant of a real XDS
 * interface, especially on the query side. Several minor modification has also
 * been made to suit the case study better. One notable change is that a real
 * XDS does not support changing documents, it is an immutable database.
