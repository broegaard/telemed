/**
  This package contains the main roles of the <b>Broker</b> pattern
    that allows distributed/remote methods to be called. 
  <p>
    All these roles and abstractions are generic - they are not
    specific to the TeleMed system. However, remember that (as is
    true for any design pattern) that implementation may vary
    from one case to the next.
  <p>
    Please refer to "Flexible Reliable Software, 2nd Edition".
